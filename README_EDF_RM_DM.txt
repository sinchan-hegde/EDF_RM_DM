# Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms: EDF, RM, and DM

## Overview

This project provides implementations of three fundamental real-time scheduling algorithms:
Earliest Deadline First (EDF), Rate Monotonic (RM), and Deadline Monotonic (DM). These
algorithms are pivotal in ensuring that tasks in real-time systems meet their timing constraints.
The project serves as an educational tool to understand and compare the behaviors and
efficiencies of these scheduling strategies.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**: Includes separate implementations for EDF, RM, and DM scheduling algorithms.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Facilitates the study of how each algorithm schedules tasks,
  helping users grasp their differences and use-cases.
- **Educational Resource**: Designed to aid students and professionals in learning about real-time scheduling
  concepts and their practical applications.

## Project Structure

- `EDF/`: Contains the implementation of the Earliest Deadline First scheduling algorithm.
- `RM/`: Contains the implementation of the Rate Monotonic scheduling algorithm.
- `DM/`: Contains the implementation of the Deadline Monotonic scheduling algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sinchan-hegde/EDF_RM_DM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Algorithm Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd EDF_RM_DM/EDF
   ```

3. **Compile and Run**:
